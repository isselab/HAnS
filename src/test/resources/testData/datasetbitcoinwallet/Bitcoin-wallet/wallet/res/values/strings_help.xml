			<b>Important safety notes:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Bitcoins are stored on the device.
			<b>If you lose it, you\'ll lose your Bitcoins.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This means you need to <b>back up your wallet</b>!
			Use the in-app backup facility for this, rather than a third party backup app.
			Keep your backup safe and remember the password.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Before uninstalling</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Bitcoins to another wallet</b>.
			Remaining Bitcoins will be lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
			If you send your Bitcoins into the void, there is almost no way to get them back.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
			Do not root your device.
			Do only install apps you fully trust.
			Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep the risk low!
			<b>Store only a reasonable amount</b> for day use.

            <b>Technical notes:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            As an SPV/light wallet, Bitcoin Wallet follows the chain of the most proof-of-work (sometimes also called the \"longest chain\", the \"winning chain\" or the \"Bitcoin blockchain\").
            You will only receive incoming payments and be able to pay on that chain.
            No guarantees can be made about Bitcoins on minority chains, that is chains with less proof-of-work.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past, minority chains have always become irrelevant very quickly.
            If you desire to follow a minority chain anyway, you are advised to use the \"trusted peer\" feature to exclusively connect to a bitcoind implementation which enforces your desired chain.
            If the network between your wallet and the trusted peer is not to be trusted, use a VPN to authenticate that connection.
